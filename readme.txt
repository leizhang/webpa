WebPA - An Online Peer Assessment System for HE
Copyright (c) 2004-2008, Loughborough University
================================================

What is it?
===========

WebPA is an online peer assessment system, or more specifically, a peermoderated
marking system. It is designed for teams of students doing groupwork,
the outcome of which earns an overall group mark. Each student in a
group grades their team-mates (and their own) performance. This grading is
then used with the overall group mark to provide each student with an
individual grade. The individual grade reflects the students contribution to the
group.
